        <p class="tilt">Unique Indonesian Traditions That Will Hypnotize You</p>
        <div class="intro">The magic of the journey lies mainly in the discovery of a new culture.
            Wealth, it is said, results from this difference, at once astonishing and exciting,
            will lead to the open-mindedness of the traveller. Indonesia will
            certainly plunge you into a dream world with its culture and traditions.
        </div>
        <div class="intro-2">The Republic of Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, has 203 million
            people living on nearly one thousand permanently settled islands. Some two-to-three
            hundred ethnic groups with their own languages and dialects range in population from
            the Javanese (about 70 million) and Sundanese (about 30 million) on Java, to peoples
            numbering in the thousands on remote islands. The nature of Indonesian national culture
            is somewhat analogous to that of India—multicultural, rooted in older societies and
            interethnic relations, and developed in twentieth century nationalist struggles against
            a European imperialism that nonetheless forged that nation and many of its institutions.

            The national culture is most easily observed in cities but aspects of it now reach
            into the countryside as well. Indonesia's borders are those of the Netherlands East Indies,
            which was fully formed at the beginning of the twentieth century, though Dutch
            imperialism began early in the seventeenth century. Indonesian culture has historical
            roots, institutions, customs, values, and beliefs that many of its people share, but
            it is also a work in progress that is undergoing particular stresses at the beginning
            of the twenty-first century.

                    <div>
                        Located on the western coast of Sumatra Island, Nias is an exquisite island inhabited by the
                        Austronesians race which even today remain culturally diverse and authentic.
                        On this isolated Island, you can witness one of the most symbolic and challenging coming-of-age
                        rituals still in practice today, known as Fahombo.
                        <br><br>
                        The art of Fahombo first emerged because of aggressive tribe wars. As a tactic for easy invasion
                        of their enemies’ villages, the soldiers of Nias needed to be able to literally leap over the
                        defense fort.
                        Although there are no tribal wars today and people live peacefully in Nias, this jumping
                        tradition
                        has become a
                        local tradition of manhood and remains an important step in adulthood.

                    <p>Debus</p><br>
                    <div>
                        Debus is a martial art originating from Banten, with a focus on developing
                        tolerance to pain (particular self-inflicted stabbing). The performer (known as Jawara)
                        endures sword stabbing, machete slicing, or even belly piercing by spears. Other mind-blowing
                        abilities include eating fire, chewing glass, and inserting needles into various body parts.
                        These acts supposedly leave no trace of injury or harm –
                        they believe that they would be unharmed because this is a sacrifice to their god. <br><br>
                        Thus, Debus involves not only physical hardship, but vigorous mental training. To perform this
                        martial art,
                        near-superhuman inner strength, pain endurance, and years of practice are paramount.
